Download latest version of gradle.

You can download it from Gradle | Releases

After downloading it exctract all the files into a folder.

Open your android studio. Go to file->settings->Build,Execution,Deployment->Gradle.

Then choose Use local gradle distribution and in the Gradle home give path of the folder where we have extracted file.

This will solve your problem.

If you have chosen option offline work in Global Gradle settings. please uncheck it.

You have to do these settings every time you create a new project.
